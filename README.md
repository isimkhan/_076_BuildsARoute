# _076_BuildsARoute
Write a program that will print out route instructions. Your program should take 2 parameters: start point and end point. Use left, right, up and down for navigation. Insert ">" between commands. If start point equals to end point - display:

"start/end(start or end variable!) found"(See the example).

Note: you may move only clock wise.

Example:

Input: A

Input: D

Output: right > down > left: D found

Input: B

Input: D

Output: down > left: D found

Input: C

Input: C

Output: C found
